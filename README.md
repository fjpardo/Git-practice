#### Short summary
This Medium article by Josh Wulf discusses the impact of the open source concept on software developing and developers, concentraiting mostly on the abrupt shifts it is causing in the requruitment world. 

#### Thoughts
Althought the impact of GitHub on software developing is rather straightforwards, I found the idea of **Github as an equalizer** rather intriguing - this is the way he calls GitHub in the light of its ability to open a pathway to jobs and opportunities for people who would have otherwise been denied the access simply based on lack of privilege. On the other hand, the author's belief on everything eventually shifitng to a open-source format to the extent where people would not need CVs nor networks and connections since everything would be readily available on Google to search, seems slightly too naive.

#### Francisco Pardo
I also find this article interesting because I too hope to later on just rely on open-source format to be able to have everything available much simpler. This will benefit the workforce in a significant manner.
